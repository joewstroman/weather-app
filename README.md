# Weather Powered Email App

This app contains a web interface that collects user input (email address, and location). It uses xmysl as the rest api for a mysql database to store the entries. It also contains a command line tool that takes an email address and queries the Dark Sky Weather API, to obtain historical data based on that time and location (down to the hour). Then it sends a custom email
